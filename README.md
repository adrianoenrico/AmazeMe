#AmazeME
A game about solving as many mazes as you can (with stupid pictures of your friends/family) before the timer ends. 

## Vcc's (just the good n' easy stuff) - App settings

* Player Sprite:
  - This one is great because it allows you to change the PLAYER IMG. It's ideally an img ranging from 8x8 pixels to 32x32px. For cooler results, use a pic that gives the impression of direction.
  - A great tool for editing images for best results is [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/)
* Player Img Size:
  - If you change your player image, you might need to make it bigger or smaller, depending on the image. 
* Player Flip:
  - This toggle tells the game if the player is looking right or left by default. If your Player img is looking left by default, check this. If it's looking right, then uncheck it.
* Countdown:
  - This enables/disables the game countdown. For any basic challenge you should leave this on.
* Background color:
  - Choose the color you see in the background. (I'm a dude but I've been really into shades of pink since after watching Her)
* Counter text color:
  - This will change the color of the text your see in the top left of the screen. 
* Start Menu button icon and Game over button icon :
    - I'm lazy so my start menu is a simple img of a play button from [IconMonstr](https://iconmonstr.com/) made interactive. You can change this. For better results use a PNG of about 120x120 px.


## Assets: don't mess with these if you don't know what you're doing.
 If you do tho, use [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)  to edit stuff.
